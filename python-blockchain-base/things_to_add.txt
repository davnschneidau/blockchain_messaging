Things I think still need to be added...

- a messging component of every block node in the blockchain directory
- encryption of the message before it is included in the json blockchian element
- additional structure to support cross computer functionality
- proof of work/verification that is diversified/decentralized

(feel free Zeke to add more things you see that might need to be added)
